<p> This is the homepage for the workshop <b>Fluidity in Human-Agent Interaction</b> at the <a href="https://hai-conference.net/hai2024/" target="_blank">12th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI 2024)</a> hosted at Swansea University, United Kingdom.

<h2>Motivation for the workshop</h2>
The property of fluidity in embodied communication is often discussed, but not formally defined. It is a property of human-human face-to-face spoken communication which makes transitions between contributions seamless, and allows appropriate overlaps of speech and non-speech action. It can be present in purely non-verbal contexts too, such as in dance. 

<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in improving the fluidity of human-agent interaction. Both those interested from engineering, social science perspectives, and other disciplines, focussed on defining what makes an interaction fluid and how this property can be implemented in machines for more natural interaction.

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p>Abstracts of 500 words (max) are welcome on any concept relating to the property of fluid interaction with artificial agents. Existing work is welcome as a means of presenting the ideas, and select abstracts will be chosen for a joint publication of a journal article on the topic after the workshop. Topics are welcome on, but not limited to, the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Definitions (formal or otherwise) of more and less fluid interaction with agents.</li>
	<li>Timing of contributions, both speech and movement, in interaction.</li>
	<li>Natural overlap&nbsp;of speech contributions.</li>
	<li>Natural overlap&nbsp;of movement, gestural and other multimodal interaction.</li>
	<li>Perceptions of smooth, fluid interaction with artificial agents.</li>
	<li>Predictive processing for embodied agents.</li>
</ul>
